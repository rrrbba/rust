# rust

A repository for holding small rust programs for learning purposes

## Commands

- rustc main.rs
- ./main or ./main.exe
- creating new project in Cargo (cargo new name_of_project)
- building Cargo project (cargo build)
- running exe for Cargo project (./target/debug/hello_cargo)
- compiling and run exe for cargo project (cargo run)
- checks code to ensure it compiles but doesn't build an exe with Cargo (cargo check)
- When ready for release (cargo build --release) and it compiles it with optimizations
- When you want to update a crate (cargo update) -> ignores Cargo.lock and figures out the latest versions that fit the specs in Cargo.toml
- Seeing documentation for a crate (cargo doc --open)

## Notes

- Cargo is the package manager
